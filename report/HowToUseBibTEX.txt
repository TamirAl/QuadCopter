go to  http://jabref.sourceforge.net/ and run the program, either installed or web-started. 

Most papers have a bibtex 'button' press it. either it saves a .bib file, open this in jab ref and 
transfer reference (copy paste entry) to our library ('biblib.bib'). or if it links you to plain text copy and paste all and dump into the entry window
with and specific references minimises (else it pasts the infor into a references feild). 

I reccomend you copy and paste the abstract to the abstract feild. 

Save the .bib file. 


When in sublime use \cite{}. when cursor is in the braces press ctrl+L, Ctrl+space. drop down list appears, select reference. boom. 

If you edit a entry in jabref after a compile you should delete the .bbl file to ensure the latex doc updates.
