  booktitle = {RoboCup Symposium},
  year = {2011},

  abstract = {Real-time 3D perception of the surrounding environment is a
	
	crucial precondition for the reliable and safe application of mobile
	service
	
	robots in domestic environments. Using a RGB-D camera, we present
	a
	
	system for acquiring and processing 3D (semantic) information at frame
	
	rates of up to 30Hz that allows a mobile robot to reliably detect
	obstacles
	
	and segment graspable objects and supporting surfaces as well as the
	
	overall scene geometry. Using integral images, we compute local surface
	
	normals. The points are then clustered, segmented, and classiﬁed in
	both
	
	normal space and spherical coordinates. The system is tested in diﬀerent
	
	setups in a real household environment.
	
	The results show that the system is capable of reliably detecting
	obstacles
	
	at high frame rates, even in case of obstacles that move fast or not
	
	considerably stick out of the ground. The segmentation of all planes
	in
	
	the 3D data even allows for correcting characteristic measurem},
